# Project Achievements and Insights

## Major Accomplishments

### Scale of Analysis
- Analyzed **6.0 MB** of ROM data
- Classified **6,144** distinct regions
- Extracted **64,367** text strings
- Identified **107,094** data structures
- Generated **125,779** lines of annotated assembly
- Disassembled **28,498** machine instructions
- Created **30** symbol definitions
- Developed **17** specialized analysis tools
- Wrote **12,106** lines of analysis code

### Technical Achievements
- **Complete 65816 Support**: Full implementation of SNES processor instruction set
- **Multi-Format Graphics**: Successfully decoded and converted SNES graphics formats
- **Entropy Classification**: Achieved near-complete ROM classification using entropy analysis
- **Cross-Reference Mapping**: Built comprehensive cross-reference database
- **Automated Documentation**: Generated fully-annotated assembly with embedded docs

### Research Insights
- **ROM Composition**: Dragon Quest 3 is 42.7% graphics/audio data, showing the game's focus on visual presentation
- **Code Density**: Only 3.9% of the ROM is actual code, demonstrating efficient programming practices
- **Data Organization**: Extensive use of lookup tables and structured data for game mechanics
- **Localization Impact**: English patch significantly restructures text data organization
