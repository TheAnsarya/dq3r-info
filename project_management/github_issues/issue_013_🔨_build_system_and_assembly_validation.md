## Description


## Objective
Ensure all generated assembly can be built and produces correct ROM.

## Build Validation Requirements
- [ ] Assembly syntax validation
- [ ] Label/symbol resolution testing
- [ ] Memory layout verification
- [ ] ROM output validation
- [ ] Checksum verification

## Current Build Status
- ✅ 125,779 lines of assembly generated
- 🔄 No build verification implemented
- 🔄 Need comprehensive build testing

## Build Infrastructure Needed
- [ ] 65816 assembler integration (ca65/wla-dx)
