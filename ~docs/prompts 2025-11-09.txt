create a new github repository named `dq3r-info` and download it to `C:\Users\me\source\repos\dq3r-info\`  and then use `C:\Users\me\source\repos\dq3r-info\` as our vscode workspace; that is a completed disassembly/documentation/asset-extraction-reinsertion/editor-suite for `Dragon Quest 3 (SNES)` based on the structure of our FFMQ project at `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info`, copy `.editorconfig` and other helping files, install all the helper programs, setup the python virtual environment, etc; the japanese rom, which we will be disassembling and documenting is at `C:\Users\me\source\repos\dq3r-info\static\Dragon Quest III - Soshite Densetsu he... (J).smc` but there is an english translation, some save states, and a usage file and a `diz` file (diztinguish); add `/static/` to gitignore so we don't push the rom file to source control, but copy the diz file somewhere else so it is in git control;

make a github kanban board for this repository/project then (every session, now and in the future) always make new issues/todo-lists for every progress effort so that ALL progress is tracked, go back and add a project creation issue with a list of what was done; update the session/chat logs every prompt; run formatting on the files every prompt; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space; git commit and push every prompt; make a new branch for each issue and then merge it back into main when you're done and get rid of the old branch; Setup an SNES development project for the complete disassembly and commenting and documentation of `Dragon Quest 3 (SNES)` (DQ3r) with a full toolset from coding, to build, to test, to running it using MesenS. Document everything. Some documentation can be found at `https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/Dragon_Quest_III_(SNES)` and `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/GameInfo/tree/main/Dragon%20Quest%20III%20(SNES)` ; steal the build system etc from ffmq-info as long as it fits our development

there is loads of information and compression algorithms and data structures, etc in my githib project `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/logsmall` so use this as a base for compression and other stuff but update it; continue setting up build system and asset pipeline and disassembly and tools, etc, ; run formatting on the files every prompt; update the session/chat logs every prompt; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space; 

disassemble as much code as you can starting by using the `diz` diztinguish file and all the manual disassembly I have already done in my other DQ3r github projects and document the functions and data structures as you go ; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space; make sure you document the complicated bank switching system for the code if applicable; and make progress tables for code disassembly and asset extraction/conversion and documentation; always format everything and always use tabs (not spaces); show our token usage at the end

create a github issue/todo for every piece of work and add it to the kanban board; git commit and push every prompt; update the session/chat logs every prompt; run formatting on the files every prompt; make a new branch for each issue and then merge it back into main when you're done and get rid of the old branch; now disassemble and document absolutely everything you can; disassemble and document all code!

maximize disassembly coverage; document and disassemble everything you can; and, as with the `ffmq-info` project for reference, implement the whole "build the rom from the source code and assets pipeline and compare it with the reference rom" processes and then build and compare and report the comparison

I do not see any assembly files in the `src` folder or the `disassembly` folder, where is the code? disassemble as much code as you can! use up every session token you can! do as much work as you can, take forevrer, just disassemble code and document it; also convert extracted graphics to png using palettes

git commit and push every prompt; Sorry to interupt, but all ASM code should be lowercase and ALL hexadecimal values in all files NEED to be lowercase; continue what you were doing; document all the code so we have a complete disassembly of the rom;; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space; create a github issue/todo for every piece of work and add it to the kanban board; git commit and push every prompt; update the session/chat logs every prompt; run formatting on the files every prompt; make a new branch for each issue and then merge it back into main when you're done and get rid of the old branch; now disassemble and document absolutely everything you can; disassemble and document all code!

you say there are 19 github issues but I don't see any in github? Where is all the planning?

put a timestamp on the IDE chat window for every response line so I know when it happened; Install WLA-DX assembler; then start working the guthub issues; make sure you're using the reference materials like `https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/Dragon_Quest_III_(SNES)/ROM_map` for the overworld format; continue and disassemble and document; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space; git commit and push every prompt; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;

put a timestamp on the IDE chat window for every response line using the actuakl time, not time since prompt started; for all new work, always make github issues before working; the graphics do nt look like  like anything in the game, make sure the address translation is correct: SNES addresses are NOT file addresses; start working the guthub issues; git commit and push every prompt; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;
